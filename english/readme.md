Obama's speech (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7pc2j5OGp8)

Tonight is a particular honor for me because 
```
오늘밤은 / 특별히 더 영광스럽다 / 나에게 / 왜냐하면
```

let's face it
```
솔직히 말해서 (현실을 직시해서)
```

my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely
```
나의 존재 / 이 연단에서 / 거의 불가능한 일입니다.
```

my father was a foreign student.
```
나의 아버지는 외국인 유학생이었습니다.
```

born and raised in  a small village in Kenya
```
태어났고 / 자랐습니다 / 작은 마을에서 / 케냐의
```

He grew up herding goats
```
그는 / 자랐다 / 염소를 몰면서
```

went to school in a tin-roof shack.
```
학교를 다녔다 / 양철지붕으로된 판잣집의
```

His father my grandfather was a cook. a domestic servant to the british
```
그의 아버지 / 나의 할아버지는 / 요리사였다 / 영국인 가정의 하인
```

But my gradfather had larger dreams for his son.
```
하지만 / 나의 할아버지는 / 가졌다 / 더 큰 꿈을 / 그의 아들에게
```

Through hard work and perseverance
```
엄청난 노력과 끈기를 통해
```
my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place
```
나의 아버지는 / 받았다 / 장학금을 / 공부하기 위해서(할수 있도록) / 마법을 땅에서 
```

America that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before
미국 / 빛났습니다 / 등불로 / 자유와 기회로 / 수많은 이들에게 / 왔던 / 이전에

While studying here, my father met my mother.
동안 / 공부하는 / 여기서 / 아버지는 / 만났다 / 어머니를

She was born in a town on the other side of the world.
그녀는 / 태어났습니다 / 타운에서 / 반대편의 / 세계

My parents shared not only an improbable love,
나의 부모님은 / 공유하셨다 / 뿐만 아니라 / 불가능해 보이는 사랑

they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.
그들은 / 공유하였다 / 굳건한 / 신념을 / 가능성에 대한 / 이 나라의

They would give me an African name believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.
그들은 / 주었다 / 나에게 / 아프리카식 이름을 / 믿으면서 / 관대한(참을성있는) 미국에서 / 너의 이름은 / 장벽이 아니다 / 성공에

They imagined me going to the best schools in the land 
그들은 / 상상했습니다 / 나를 / 다니다 / 최고의 학교에 / 미국전체에서(이 땅안에서)

even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential.
비록 / 그들은 / 부유하지 않았다 / 왜냐하면 / 관대한 미국에서 / 너는 / ~할 필요가 없다 / 부유한 / 발휘하기 위해서 / 너의 잠재력을

















America
국민 여러분
