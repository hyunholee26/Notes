Obama's speech (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7pc2j5OGp8)

Tonight is a particular honor for me because 
```
오늘밤은 / 특별히 더 영광스럽다 / 나에게 / 왜냐하면
```

let's face it
```
솔직히 말해서 (현실을 직시해서)
```

my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely
```
나의 존재 / 이 연단에서 / 거의 불가능한 일입니다.
```

my father was a foreign student.
```
나의 아버지는 외국인 유학생이었습니다.
```

born and raised in  a small village in Kenya
```
태어났고 / 자랐습니다 / 작은 마을에서 / 케냐의
```

He grew up herding goats
```
그는 / 자랐다 / 염소를 몰면서
```

went to school in a tin-roof shack.
```
학교를 다녔다 / 양철지붕으로된 판잣집의
```

His father my grandfather was a cook. a domestic servant to the british
```
그의 아버지 / 나의 할아버지는 / 요리사였다 / 영국인 가정의 하인
```

But my gradfather had larger dreams for his son.
```
하지만 / 나의 할아버지는 / 가졌다 / 더 큰 꿈을 / 그의 아들에게
```

Through hard work and perseverance
```
엄청난 노력과 끈기를 통해
```
my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place
```
나의 아버지는 / 받았다 / 장학금을 / 공부하기 위해서(할수 있도록) / 마법을 땅에서 
```
