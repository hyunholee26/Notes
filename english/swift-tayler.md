Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you

In your life you will inevitably 
misspeak, trust the wrong person,
under react, overreact, 
hurt the people who didn't deserve it
overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage,
create a reality where only your experience exists
ruin perfectly good monents for yourself and others
deny any wrong doing
not take the steps to make it right
feel very guilty
let the guilt eat at you
hit rock bottom
Finally, address the pain you caused
try to do better next time
rinse and repeat

I know I sound like a consummate optimist
but I'm really not. I lose perspective all the time. 
Sometimes everything just feels completely pointless.
I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism.

Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. 
Part of growing up, and moving into new chapters of your life, is about catch and release.

What I mean by that is, knowing what things to keep, and what things to release.
You can't carry all things. Decide, what is yours to hold and let the rest go.

How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments?
You won't

How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices?
I won't

The scary news is you're on your own now.
but the cool news is you're on your own now.

We are led by our gut instincts our intuition, our desires, and fears, our scars and our dreams. Hard things will happen to us. We will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it. And as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing

we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out. We're doing this together. 
So let's just keep dancing, like we are class of 22.
